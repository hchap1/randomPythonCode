# randomPythonCode
All of my random python code I work on over different periods.

NOTE:

Must have following modules for most of the code:

Requests

On windows, in CMD, pip install requests. If using a VPN:

pip install <package name> --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org
  
  -Which will stop certificate being re-routed.
  
Also, need python 3.9 or later.
